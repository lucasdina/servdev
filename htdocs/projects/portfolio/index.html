            <h1>Skills</h1>
            <p>After starting with C#, I realized that I did not like it at all. Since then, I have devoted my time to learning other Java and node.js. Regarding Java, I have a lot of experience with android developement and many common android libraries. My http tool of choice would be Jackson in Java, but I also have quite a bit of experience with RxJava. In node.js, I am familiar with the Express library as I have written an API with it. As for serving content, I prefer Handlebars, but I am open to learning new tools at any time.</p>
            <h1>Projects</h1>
            <p>For the most part, my personal projects revolve around mobile developement. My current app is called Jukebox (not in app stores yet). Jukebox is a music sharing app that allow people to send music to a DJ to play anywhere, whether it be in the car with friends, or even at a party. The voting system I implemented allows for users to vote for songs they like and get them moved to the top of the list. Besides that, I have an interest in automation. Creating bots for videogames has proven quite the challenge but very fun none the less.</p>
